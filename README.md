# Cave Game

---

Simple game where you control a single ASCII character to move around the frame.

# Build from source

Right now I recommend building from source as it's the most straight forward way to play the game until I figure out how to add Windows binaries.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:maxju64/cave-game.git
cd cave-game/
make
build/./cave
```
